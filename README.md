# Assignment Overview

## 1. Core Java
In the Core Java section, I implemented examples demonstrating various fundamental and advanced Java concepts:

### Example 1: "University Example" (Comprehensive Java Concepts)
- **Abstract Class and Abstract Methods**: Demonstrated the use of abstract classes and methods.
- **Interfaces**: Explored interface inheritance and implemented multiple interfaces.
- **Comparator and Comparable**: Showcased sorting techniques using `Comparator` and `Comparable` interfaces.
- **`super` Keyword**: Demonstrated the use of `super` to access parent class properties and methods.

### Example 2: Exception Handling and File IO
- **Exception Handling**: Covered runtime exceptions such as `ArithmeticException`, `IndexOutOfBoundsException`, and custom exception handling.


### Example 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism
- **All Types of Inheritance**: Single, multiple (through interfaces), hierarchical,hybrid , and multilevel inheritance were implemented.
- **Polymorphism**: Both compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding) polymorphism were showcased.

## 2. DBMS
In the Database Management System (DBMS) section, I demonstrated:
- **University Schema**: Used a pre-defined university schema.
- **Basic Queries**: Implemented SQL queries to perform CRUD operations, joins, groupings,Union , and filtering.

## 3. Client-Side Programming
For the client-side programming section, I developed the front-end of a login and registration page using:
- **HTML**: Web Pages
- **CSS**: Styled the forms.
- **JavaScript**: Added validation for email and password fields, ensuring input correctness before submission.

## 4. Servlets and JDBC
In this section, I:
- **Basic Hello World Program**: Created a servlet running on Apache Tomcat to display a simple "Hello World" message.
- **Login and Registration Application**:
  - Developed the backend using **Java Servlets** and integrated with **MySQL** using JDBC.
  - Reused the frontend forms from the client-side programming section.
  - Implemented:
    - **Registration**: Stored user data in a database.
    - **Login**: Validated user credentials against the database.
  - **Database Schema**: Designed a user table with fields for email, username, and password
